# Standard AI Project Setup Workflow

## 📝 Overview

This project follows a strict, isolated environment policy using **`conda`**. All dependencies, including Python, CUDA, and `pip` packages, are managed *inside* a dedicated environment to prevent conflicts and ensure easy cleanup.

> **Note for AI Assistants (Copilot):**
>
> * **Do NOT** suggest installing any packages globally or in the `(base)` conda environment.
> * All `pip install` or `conda install` commands must be run *after* activating the project's dedicated environment (`conda activate my-project-env`).
> * The `cudatoolkit` version is managed by `conda` and is specific to this environment.

## 🚀 1. Project Setup (One-Time)

This must be done for **every new project** to create its isolated "workshop."

### Step 1: Create the Conda Environment

This command creates a new, empty environment with a specific Python version.

```bash
# Replace 'my-project-env' with your project's name
# You can change 'python=3.10' to any version you need
conda create -n my-project-env python=3.10
Step 2: Activate the Environment
You must "enter" the environment to work in it. Your terminal prompt will change to indicate the active environment.

Bash

conda activate my-project-env
Step 3: Install Dependencies
Install large core libraries (like pytorch and cudatoolkit) first using conda for best compatibility. Then, install other Python packages using pip.

Bash

# Example: Install PyTorch and the matching CUDA toolkit from conda
# Using conda ensures CUDA compatibility
conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=12.1 -c pytorch -c nvidia

# Example: Install other Python libraries using pip
pip install vllm transformers requirements-file.txt
💻 2. Daily Workflow
Step 1: Activate Environment
Before coding, always activate the correct project environment.

Bash

conda activate my-project-env
Step 2: Code and Run
Work on your project (run scripts, notebooks, etc.).

Step 3: Deactivate Environment
When finished, exit the environment to return to (base).

Bash

conda deactivate
🧹 3. Project Cleanup
Saving Dependencies
If you installed new packages, update your requirements.txt file.

Bash

# Auto-generates/updates the requirements file
pip freeze > requirements.txt
Deleting the Project Environment
When completely finished with a project, delete the entire environment to reclaim all disk space (often 10+ GB).

Bash

# This completely removes the environment and all its packages
conda env remove -n my-project-env
